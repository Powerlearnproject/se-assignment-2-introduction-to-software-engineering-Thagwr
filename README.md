Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is an engineering approach to software development.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software
Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform task.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1. Planning & Analysis
The first phase of the SDLC is the project planning stage where you are gathering business requirements from your client or stakeholders.
2. Define Requirements
This phase is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requirements for the development team. This process guides the development of several important documents: a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification, a Use Case document, and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.
3. Design
The design phase is where you put pen to paper—so to speak. The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document (SDD) that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use, and application security measures
4. Development
The actual development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product. 
5. Testing
Before getting the software product out the door to the production environment, it’s important to have your quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do
6. Deployment
During the deployment phase, your final product is delivered to your intended user
7. Maintenance
The maintenance phase is the final stage of the SDLC if you’re following the waterfall structure of the software development process. However, the industry is moving towards a more agile software development approach where maintenance is only a stage for further improvement.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
Waterfall examines after the “Build” phase, while Agile tests during software development. Agile allows for adjustments to project requirements, while Waterfall does not allow for modifications of the requirements once the project is in progress
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement’s engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which a software/Web application may be divided into smaller modules. Software modularity indicates that the number of application modules are capable of serving a specified business domain.
At its core, modularity aims to improve software development by partitioning complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. By breaking down a large software system into smaller modules, developers can focus on writing code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Levels of software testing:
1 Unit testing
Unit testing is a software testing process for testing specific units, components, or software elements
2 Integration testing
Next is integration testing, which is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure everything is ready for the next level
3 System testing
The next level of software testing is system testing. This checks for a system’s compliance in accordance with the necessary given requirements. System testing inspects components like performance, load, reliability, and security with the goal of evaluating the end-to-end system specifications. 
2 Integration testing
Next is integration testing, which is when different software components and modules are combined and tested as a group to make sure everything is ready for the next level. 
3 System testing
The next level of software testing is system testing. This checks for a system’s compliance in accordance with the necessary given requirements. System testing inspects components like performance, load, reliability, and security with the goal of evaluating the end-to-end system specifications. 
4 Acceptance testing
Finally, there’s acceptance testing. What makes this level different from the rest is that it’s conducted by the user or customer since the goal is to find out if the requirements have been met on delivery of the final product.
Software testing is necessary in software engineering because it provides the following benefits:
•	Identification and removal of errors: Testing helps find and fix defects, ensuring a more reliable and robust software product.
•	Verification of functionality: Testing ensures that the software functions as expected and meets requirements.
•	Conformance to business needs and technical specifications: Thorough testing ensures alignment with project goals and specifications.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
A version control system is a software tool that helps software teams track and manage changes to source code over time. It takes snapshots of the files and stores them permanently, so they can be recalled later if needed. It also helps developers communicate and collaborate on code changes, and avoid conflicts and errors. Version control systems can be centralized or distributed, depending on how the versions are stored and accessed2.
Some examples of version control systems are:
•	Git: a popular, distributed VCS that offers simple branching and merging capabilities.
•	Subversion (SVN): a widely adopted, centralized VCS developed by Apache.
•	Mercurial: a distributed VCS that offers simple branching and merging capabilities.
•	Helix Core: a centralized VCS by Perforce Software.
•	ClearCase: a software configuration management tool by IBM

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
The role of a software project manager includes the following responsibilities:
•	Preparing project proposals and discussing potential projects with clients and stakeholders
•	Facilitating project initiation by defining project scope and requirements, and preparing the necessary documents and requirements
•	Developing project plans and timelines to ensure the timely submission of project deliverables
•	Managing project budgets and resources to ensure the timely completion of milestones
